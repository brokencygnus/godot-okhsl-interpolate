# OKHSL Picker

## What's this?

A tool to pick two colours in OKHSL and interpolate between them. This allows for creating palettes with perceptual uniformity.

## Installation

Just clone the repo and open OKHSL Picker.exe

## What is OKHSL and OKHSL Picker (from original repo)

A very simple tool that basically just takes Godot's OKHSL colour picker and makes it a standalone program. OKHSL is a version of HSL that normalises perceived brightness among hues, making it easier to pick colours that match in "real world" brightness. For more info, [read here](https://bottosson.github.io/posts/colorpicker/).

The interface for the colour picker is entirely built by the Godot devs, all I did was wrap it up in a nice standalone window with the ability to pin it, making it "always on top". You can check out Godot [here](https://godotengine.org/), and view/contribute to its source [here](https://github.com/godotengine/godot).
